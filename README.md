# Next.js Component Unexpected Unmount

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Next.js component unmounts unexpectedly.  This prevents proper cleanup in the `useEffect` hook, leading to console errors or unexpected behavior.  The solution showcases how to address this by ensuring proper lifecycle management within your components.

## Bug
The `MyComponent` unexpectedly unmounts before it should, causing the cleanup function in `useEffect` to not be executed. This is a common issue when dealing with dynamic component rendering in Next.js. 

## Solution
The solution involves careful review of how components are rendered and updated.  In some cases, optimisations in Next.js might trigger premature unmounting. The solution might involve using techniques like memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders, or more explicit state management to control when components are updated.  If the unmount is caused by routing or page changes, the issue might be a result of React's reconciliation process.
